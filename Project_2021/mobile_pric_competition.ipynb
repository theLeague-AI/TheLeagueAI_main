    "Smartphones are an integral part of the lives of human beings. When making the decision to purchase a phone, many factors like the display, processor, memory, camera, thickness, battery and connectivity are taken into account. With so many options in the market customers find it increasingly difficult to estimate whether the product they are purchasing is worth the cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "Today you will attempt at solving this problem by generating a machine learning model capable of predicting the cost of a smartphone taking the historical data pertaining to the key features of smartphones along with their cost. A model capable of predicting the value of a new smartphone can be a powerful tool for customers who are looking to make the best investment when buying a new phone."
