    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "<p>Commercial banks receive <em>a lot</em> of applications for credit cards. Many of them get rejected for many reasons, like high loan balances, low income levels, or too many inquiries on an individual's credit report, for example. Manually analyzing these applications is mundane, error-prone, and time-consuming (and time is money!). Luckily, this task can be automated with the power of machine learning and pretty much every commercial bank does so nowadays. In this notebook, we will build an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, just like the real banks do.</p>\n",

    "- The data is sitting on a csv file named cc_approvals.vsv\n",
    "-  You will find that since this data is confidential, the creator of the dataset has anonymized the feature names\n",
    "- The probable features in a typical credit card application are <code>Gender</code>, <code>Age</code>, <code>Debt</code>, <code>Married</code>, <code>BankCustomer</code>, <code>EducationLevel</code>, <code>Ethnicity</code>, <code>YearsEmployed</code>, <code>PriorDefault</code>, <code>Employed</code>, <code>CreditScore</code>, <code>DriversLicense</code>, <code>Citizen</code>, <code>ZipCode</code>, <code>Income</code> and finally the <code>ApprovalStatus</code>. This gives us a pretty good starting point, and we can map these features with respect to the columns in the output.\n"
