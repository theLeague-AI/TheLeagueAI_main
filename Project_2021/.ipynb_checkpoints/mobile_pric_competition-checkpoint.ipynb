    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "Smartphones are an integral part of the lives of human beings. When a smartphone is purchased, many factors like the display, processor, memory, camera, thickness, battery, connectivity and others are taken into account. One factor that people do not consider is whether the product is worth the cost. As there are no resources to cross-validate the price, people fail in taking the correct decision.\n",
    "\n",
    "This project intends to solve this issue by taking the historical data pertaining to the key features of smartphones along with their cost and develop a model that will predict the approximate price of the new smartphone with a reasonable accuracy."
